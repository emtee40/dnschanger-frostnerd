    <string name="info_text_how_does_it_work">Android allows you to configure DNS servers in the wifi settings - but not for mobile connections (3G, 4G…). This however requires you to use a static IP address, doesn\'t allow switching easily and won\'t work with IPv6, among other disadvantages when compared to this app.\n\nThis app takes advantage of Androids VPN structure which allows devices to set DNS servers dynamically. To achieve this a local vpn is created which uses the same device as endpoint - this means the vpn connection neither connects to the internet itself, nor is it detectable from outside.\nAs this dummy-VPN can be started/stopped dynamically it allows for a range of features and automatation. This VPN isn\'t tapped and no data is read by it. It\'s just a middle man in changing the DNS servers.\n\nIf you are interested in the technical side of this, visit my git at git.frostnerd.com.</string>

    <string name="feature_shortcuts">Using this app you can create shortcuts on your home screen.
