    <string name="info_text_how_does_it_work">Android allows you to configure DNS servers in the wifi settings - but not for mobile connections (3G, 4Gâ€¦). This however requires you to use a static IP address, doesn\'t allow switching easily and won\'t work with IPv6, among other disadvantages when compared to this app.\n\nThis app takes advantage of Androids VPN structure which allows devices to set DNS servers dynamically. To achieve this a local vpn is created which uses the same device as endpoint - this means the vpn connection neither connects to the internet itself, nor is it detectable from outside.\nAs this dummy-VPN can be started/stopped dynamically it allows for a range of features and automatation. This VPN isn\'t tapped and no data is read by it. It\'s just a middle man in changing the DNS servers.\n\nIf you are interested in the technical side of this, visit my git at git.frostnerd.com.</string>
    <string name="create_one">Create one</string>
    <string name="feature_shortcuts">Using this app you can create shortcuts on your home screen. These shortcuts contain DNS settings and change your DNS servers by clicking them without needing you to open the app.\nThis makes them particular convenient if you want to quickly cycle between different servers - just create a bunch of the shortcuts and let them rest on your home screen.\n\nYou can configure the behavior of them in the settings.</string>

    <string name="feature_pin_protection">You can pin-protect every action which starts/stops/pauses/resumes DNSChanger. Each time one of those is to be executed a dialog shows asking for the pin set by you.\n\nThis can be used for hindering the phones user from interfering with the app if the user isn\'t to tech-savvy. It was developed to stop children from stopping the app.\nTo choose what to protect open the settings.</string>
