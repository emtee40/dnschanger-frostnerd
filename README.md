This is the source code for my app DNS Changer, which can be found here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frostnerd.dnschanger<br><br>
**Important**: As it is quite old I'd suggest you to use my other app Nebulo. It doesn't have normal (unencrypted) DNS and rather relies on DNS-over-HTTPS and DNS-over-TLS (Private DNS). It also looks better and is more stable.<br>
It is open source as well. You can find it on Google Play [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frostnerd.smokescreen) and the source code [here](https://git.frostnerd.com/PublicAndroidApps/Smokescreen).
I'd suggest you check out the repo as it contains useful information and also information on how to download Nebulo using the F-Droid app.

Have a look at the wiki for this app: https://git.frostnerd.com/PublicAndroidApps/DnsChanger/wikis/home<br>
This app could possibly spy on using the VPN connection which has to be used to apply the chosen DNS Servers. **It doesn't**. This project is open source so that people familiar with Java/Android can check on this promise.<br>

Feel free to contribute to this project, it's completely free to sign up and I'd be happy to fix issues or implement requests.<br>
I would also be very grateful for translations. I have a WebLate instance where you can add and manage translations. It can be found [here](https://weblate.frostnerd.com/projects/dns-changer/).
